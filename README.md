# Multi host Vagrant/Virtualbox Setup

## Requirements
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

These are Vagrant boxes I'm using to quickly build out clusters and test new software.  Each cluster can be found in their respective designated folder.  BASH scripts for Centos7 deploys are found in the root of this repository.

Currently playing around with Chef.
