# Multi host Vagrant/Virtualbox Setup

## Requirements
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

These are Vagrant boxes I'm using to quickly build out clusters and test new software.  Each cluster can be found in their respective designated folder.  Reusable bash scripts are found in the root of this repository.

Currently using [Centos 7](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/7) vagrant boxes.
